<p><span data-jsid="text">Daytime TV sucks. Like the weather and the roads, that's
	not MARTA's fault -- but since I'm a MARTA rider it definitely became my problem
	this week. To keep from going crazy on my snow days, I busied myself by mocking
	up a suggestion for the MARTA website that's been in the back of my mind for
	ages.</span></p>
<p><span data-jsid="text">	First, though, let me say that I love the MyCommute pages: They're still
	new enough that I remember trying to navigate the MARTA site without them, and
	life is much better now. And they are extremely accurate, functional, and well-designed.
	But in my own work as a web developer, I know that we often ask people for
	ideas, get nothing, release a version, and then get a flood of suggestions.
	And we understand that this is because people need to see something before they
	can conceptualize how it could be improved. I'm making these suggestions in
	that same vein: I could never, working alone, have come up with something as
	elaborate and beautiful as the MyCommute pages -- but now that they exist, that
	starting point gives me some ideas that I want to share.</span></p>
<p><span data-jsid="text">	Specifically, I'm writing about the bus schedule pages where you select check
	boxes beside various bus stops to get service times. I find these pages difficult
	to read for a few reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">	The text is very dense, with all-capital lettering
	and minimal use of spaces.</span></li>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">	Because the quadrant information for streets
			(NE, NW, SE, SW) and spacing around the &quot;@&quot; is unevenly applied, even for adjacent entries of the same
		street, the &quot;@&quot; signs don't line up for stops along the same street,
		making it harder to visually scan the list quickly and hone in on stops along
		a particular stretch. On my &quot;Before&quot; mock-up link below, look at the
		10th Street stops at the bottom of the list to see what I mean about finding
		it difficult to zero in on the 10th Street section; you'll find:<br />
		10TH ST NE @ MONROE DR NE (has &quot;NE&quot; as well as spaces around &quot;@&quot;)<br />
		10TH ST NE@W PEACHTREE ST NW (has &quot;NE&quot;; no spaces around &quot;@&quot;)<br />
		10TH ST @ CHARLES ALLEN DR (drops &quot;NE&quot;; has spaces around &quot;@&quot;)<br />
		10TH ST@TAFT ST (drops &quot;NE&quot;; no spaces around &quot;@&quot;)</span></li>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">	The text is all left-justified, with no tabular
	organization of the data.</span></li>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">Because the information given is only street intersections,
			I often find it confusing to figure out the station stop for routes that cross
			-- but don't terminate at -- a station. (For example, when the 110 pulls into
		the Arts Center Station bay, that stop is identified only as   &quot;PEACHTREE ST NE@15TH ST NE.&quot;)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-jsid="text">	On my personal web space, I've mocked up an alternate display that I would
	like to share. My examples are for the northbound run of the 99 (my new favorite
	route after last year's service updates).</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">	BEFORE: For comparison, I've also saved this
		static version of the existing page: <a href="99WeekdayNB_Before.htm" target="_blank">99WeekdayN​B_Before.htm</a></span></li>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">AFTER: And here's my suggestion of how to show the
		same information (with a few added data points) instead: <a href="99WeekdayNB_After.htm" target="_blank">99WeekdayN​B_After.htm</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-jsid="text">	The mock-up incorporates the following changes:</span></p>
<ol>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">	I organized the display around what I called
			the &quot;Service Street&quot;   (i.e.,
		the street the bus is running on), making that street appear only once with
		subheadings for the cross streets. Note that even though the service street
		is visible only in its first row, it is included (in the same color as the
		background) on ALL rows; this is so the visually impaired, using screen readers,
		will have all the information they need on every row.</span></li>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">I added a &quot;Stop #&quot; link to provide access to the MARTA page for
		stop numbers. Note that for this simple mock-up, I did not throw in the scripting
		to make it figure out the time of day and include it as part of that link,
		as I think a better solution would be for these bus stop pages to assume
		the CURRENT time of day rather than 5:00 AM if the time is not provided --
		but modifying the page to serve the time as a parameter in the link would not
		be difficult at all.</span></li>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">I added an &quot;Amenities&quot; column to display various aspects of the
		bus stop that people may find useful: I retained, of course, the information
		that already exists on the MARTA website as to whether the stop is wheelchair
		accessible. And I added a symbol to identify whether it is sheltered as well
		as a symbol to indicate if it is a timing point stop. The &quot;alt&quot; tag
		is included, of course, for screen readers for the visually impaired, but I put
		the same information in the &quot;title&quot; tag so that anyone could hover
		the mouse over a symbol to see what it means. Note that if you hover over
		the shelter symbol, it will tell you not only that there is a shelter, but
		what kind (MARTA station, building, expressway overpass, bus shelter, etc.).</span></li>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">I added a &quot;Near This Stop&quot; column to identify rail stations, shared
		or intersecting bus lines, and points of interest in the vicinity of the
		various stops. I think a column like this would be enormously helpful to
		MARTA's riders, especially those unfamiliar with Atlanta and/or unfamiliar
		with MARTA. For MARTA features (i.e., stations and intersecting lines), I made
		the description a link to the relevant page on the MARTA website.</span></li>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">Just to reduce ambiguity, I put in some scripting
			to make the entire row yellow when you hover your mouse over it. (And on rows
			where the service street is hidden, it is displayed in gray while hovering
		over that row.)</span></li>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">Finally, I did a little bit of clean-up in text and
			formatting: I put the street names in mixed-case characters, and I removed
			the quadrant designators (SE, NE, NW). As for the quadrants, I removed them
			because I didn't think they helped much, and because they were sometimes incorrect.
			For example, the last stop in the original is listed as &quot;10TH ST NE@W PEACHTREE ST NW&quot; –
		but it is impossible for a single bus stop to rest in the NE quadrant of 10th
		Street and the NW quadrant of West Peachtree; West Peachtree is the boundary
		between NE and NW -- but this stop, inside the Midtown Station, is on the NE
		side of it, and the stop should actually be labeled as &quot;10TH ST NE@W PEACHTREE
		ST NE.&quot;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span data-jsid="text">	This is what I, as a rider, would find useful -- but if people have different
	ideas for how the example page could be made more readable, I'll try to mock
	those up as well if time permits. Let me know in the comments.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span data-jsid="text">The following is probably more technical than most
		people will want, but MARTA's software engineers may find it helpful: I created
		this example by converting the data for this route to XML and displaying that
		XML file with an XSL stylesheet. Primarily, I did this to demonstrate that
		this display concept could pull its content from a data source and would not
		require hard coding of every route. In the &quot;After&quot; file above, I
		just copied the generated content into the HTML because my server environment
		is not very sophisticated with server-side scripting, and doesn't give me any
		way to use an INCLUDE statement (but obviously in a real-world application
		either an INCLUDE statement of the XSL file or direct HTML generation via interaction
		with the database would be the way to go). I picked XSL mostly just because
		I wanted to play with that structure (as I haven't used it in a long time and
		wanted to remind myself of its capabilities). It may be easier to achieve the
		same kind of display by pulling directly from a database (Oracle or SQL Server
		or whatever), as I assume the MyCommute pages are doing now -- but I think
		there's an argument for storing schedule data in XML on the MARTA website:
		Eventually, businesses and government agencies could put their own &quot;hooks&quot; into
		the data, allowing them to display route and schedule information that is most
		useful in their particular contexts, but with MARTA able to affect those displays
in real time by updating the XML documents on its own website as needed.</span></p>
<p><span data-jsid="text">	Here are the design files, for anyone who may find them interesting or
	useful:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">	My raw XML data: <a href="Route99NB_raw.xml" target="_blank">Route99NB_​raw.xml</a></span></li>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">		An HTML display of my XML data: <a href="Route99NB_xml.htm" target="_blank">Route99NB_​xml.htm</a> (if the above doesn't display in your browser)</span></li>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">		My XML data with the XSL stylesheet attached: <a href="Route99NB.xml" target="_blank">Route99NB.​xml</a></span></li>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">		My XSL style sheet: <a href="ShowRoute.xsl" target="_blank">ShowRoute.​xsl</a> (shows some useful information in IE; otherwise, not much to see here)</span></li>
	<li><span data-jsid="text">		An HTML display of my XSL stylesheet: <a href="ShowRoute_xsl.htm" target="_blank">ShowRoute_​xsl.htm</a> (should work in all browsers)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-jsid="text">	For the functions that control display when you're hovering over a row,
	I used jQuery, a free cross-browser overlay to JavaScript. More information
	about jQuery can be found at their website: <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">http://jquery.com/</a>.</span></p>
<p><span data-jsid="text">	By the way, I do understand that MARTA's IT department already has a
	huge to-do list, and that even if everybody agrees with me that these
	formatting changes are worth pursuing, it won't happen immediately (or
	even soon, necessarily). But I still think it's worthwhile to share this
	kind of idea, so that MARTA will know where the enthusiasm lies as it's planning
	out its strategies. (And also, it kept me sane during the snow.)</span></p>
<p><span data-jsid="text">	If MARTA finds my code useful in the pages linked above, I grant that
	code to MARTA free-of-charge and without restriction. And I'll happily
	be available to MARTA's software engineers if they have questions, or
	are unfamiliar with the techniques I've used. (Please note, however,
	that I cribbed the shelter and stopwatch icons from a Google search; I don't
	know if there are copyrights on these images, but I'm definitely NOT the
	copyright holder if so.)</span></p>
