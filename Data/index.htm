<h1>MARTA Developer Resources</h1>
<p>This is my attempt to catalog information related to the MARTA's developer
	feeds &ndash; both for my own use and for the benefit of other programmers.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that the community would be better served if this were
	hosted on the MARTA website, so I will happily turn over these files &ndash; at
	no charge, of course &ndash; if they
	give MARTA a head start to hosting a more detailed set of developer pages.
	(But I would appreciate attribution for my work.)</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>Please be aware that I am not affiliated with MARTA. Contact information
	for MARTA can be found on the agency's website at:<br />
<a href="http://www.itsmarta.com/Contact-us.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.itsmarta.com/Contact-us.aspx</a></p>
<p>If you would like to contact me about this resource (and please feel welcome
	to do so, especially if you find any errors I need to correct), my e-mail
	address is <a href="mailto:joe@joederose.us">joe@joederose.us</a>.</p>
<h2>Real-Time Data</h2>
<p>MARTA has a real-time bus feed that provides data in XML (via a SOAP
	call) and JSON (both via SOAP and via a RESTful call). MARTA wants to
	be aware of any developers using the real-time feed, so I am <em>not</em> providing
	links to it here; instead, you will need to submit
	a request on the MARTA developer page at <a href="http://www.itsmarta.com/brd-request-form.aspx">http://www.itsmarta.com/brd-request-form.aspx</a>.
	After you submit that form, you will immediately be taken to a page with instructions
	on using the system. Since those instructions are a bit overwhelming on the
	first visit, here's what it boils down to for access to the (easier and more
	complete) RESTful feed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Click on the link immediately below the heading, &quot;MARTA Bus Real-time Data
	RESTful Web Service&quot; (near the top of the page).</li>
	<li>On the next page, click on both (&quot;GetAllBus&quot; and
		&quot;GetBusByRoute/{Route}&quot;) of the &quot;GET&quot; links in the &quot;Method&quot;
		column of the table.</li>
	<li>Take note of the URL near the top of the respective pages for those options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have the URL, you can retrieve information as follows:</p>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>URL</th>
			<th>Result</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>http://.../GetAllBus</th>
			<td>Gets the results for all active buses on all routes</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>http://.../GetBusByRoute/{Route}</th>
			<td>Replace &quot;{Route}&quot; with a route number (e.g., &quot;3&quot; or &quot;99&quot;).
				Gets the results for all buses
			on the selected route.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>This will return an array of JSON objects (one JSON object per bus), that looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
	<code>
		[{"ADHERENCE":"0","BLOCKID":"2","BLOCK_ABBR":"1-2","DIRECTION":"Southbound","LATITUDE":"33.7562339","LONGITUDE":"-84.3918858","MSGTIME":"4\/7\/2013 12:42:43 PM","ROUTE":"1","STOPID":"904680","TIMEPOINT":"Luckie St & North Ave.","TRIPID":"3698436","VEHICLE":"2981"},{"ADHERENCE":"-3","BLOCKID":"1","BLOCK_ABBR":"1-1","DIRECTION":"Northbound","LATITUDE":"33.7889023","LONGITUDE":"-84.4262254","MSGTIME":"4\/7\/2013 12:51:21 PM","ROUTE":"1","STOPID":"901556","TIMEPOINT":"Huff Rd & Howell Mill","TRIPID":"3713428","VEHICLE":"2853"}]
	</code>
</blockquote>

<p>Following, as best I understand them, are the meanings for the field names:</p>

			<th>Field Name</th>
			<th>Notes</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>

				positive numbers show the number of minutes the bus is early.</td>

			<td>(I don't yet know what this means.)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>BLOCK_ABBR</th>
			<td>(I don't yet know what this means.)</td>

			<td>Direction of the bus. This information is usually accurate &ndash; but it does
				not match any field in the GTFS data (see below). this is less of a problem
				than it used to be, as MARTA is now providing the TRIPID field in the real-time
				data.</td>
		</tr>

			<td>Latitude in decimal WGS 84 format.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>LONGITUDE</th>
			<td>Latitude in decimal WGS 84 format.</td>

				but rather the time that it most recent passed a time-point stop.
				There is no information in the GTFS data (see below) about which
				stops are time-point stops &ndash; but that information can be found on the
				online bus schedules on the MARTA website.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>ROUTE</th>
			<td>The bus number. Correlates to <strong>stops.route_short_name</strong> in
				the GTFS data (see below).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>STOPID</th>
			<td>The stop code for the most recent time-point stop. Correlates to <strong>stops.stop_id</strong> in
				the GTFS data.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>TIMEPOINT</th>
			<td>Plain text giving the location of the most recent time-point stop.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>TRIPID</th>
			<td>Correlates to <strong>trips.trip_id</strong> in the GTFS data.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>VEHICLE</th>
			<td>The bus number. (Does not correlate to any field in the GTFS data, but
				is nonetheless a useful value as it is visible to riders.)</td>
		</tr>

<h2>GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification)</h2>
<h3>Source Information</h3>

<p>The MARTA GTFS feed is available on the
	MARTA website at:<br />
<a href="http://www.itsmarta.com/marta-developer-resources.aspx">http://www.itsmarta.com/marta-developer-resources.aspx</a></p>

<p>This feed was designed for Google Transit, and meets Google's specifications
	as outlined at<br />
<a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference">https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference</a></p>
<h3>UML</h3>
<p>Following is a UML diagram of the table relationships
	in MARTA's GTFS feed. I included <strong>calendar.txt</strong> and <strong>calendar_dates.txt</strong> on
	this example to show the field relationship, but I think a query that incorporates
	these tables would be needlessly complex. For my own work, I plan to set up
	separate function calls to get the appropriate <strong>service_id</strong> from
	those tables,
	and simply pass in the resultant value as a parameter in the WHERE clause of
	the query.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="UML.jpg" alt="UML of table relationships" /></p>
<h3>Tables (.txt Files)</h3>

<p>Following are the tables provided in the MARTA GTFS feeds. Please note the
	following:</p>

<ul>	
	<li>Hyperlinks are to the Google table specifications.</li>
	<li>Data type information is not specified by MARTA nor (for most fields) by Google. The types listed below reflect my best assumption regarding the most useful data type to apply.</li>
	<li>The parenthetical numbers after &quot;text&quot; in the &quot;Data Type&quot;
		column reflect the longest line in the current dataset &ndash; not a prescribed
			maximum length. For my own database design, I intend to pad those numbers
			somewhat to allow for longer text in the future, and I recommend
			that others do the same.</li>
	<li>Notes are my own observations about the data (which I believe to be correct, of course &ndash; but which may reflect misunderstandings on my part).</li>
</ul>

<p>Parsing the <strong>arrival_time</strong> and <strong>departure_time</strong> fields into hour, minute, and
	second values is very straightforward. Most languages have a mechanism for
	manipulating strings based on regular expressions, and the VBA (VisualBasic for
	Applications) examples below illustrate a pretty common framework for parsing the
	information in languages without support for regular expressions. These techniques
	will return a text value; likely you'll want to convert it to a numerical value
	using the appropriate function in the language you're using &ndash; usually some
	variation of <strong>val()</strong>, <strong>value()</strong>, <strong>Integer()</strong> or <strong>parseInt()</strong>.</p>
